## Getting started

- Go to the course GitHub organization: https://github.com/math118-fall2022. 

- If you see a pending invite at the top of the page, accept the invite to join the course invite. We'll come back to GitHub later.

## Tour of R and RStudio 

Let's take a tour of R and RStudio. I'll do a short demo, then give you a few minutes to try out yourself. 

### Concepts introduced

- Console
- Using R as a calculator
- Environment
- Loading and viewing a data frame
- Accessing a variable in a data frame
- R functions

### Your turn!

- Go ahead and open up RStudio. 

- Use R as a calculator by typing the following in the **console**. 

```{r eval = F}
3 * 5 + 10
```

```{r eval = F}
x <- 3
x + x^2
```

```{r eval = F}
x <- 1:10
x*7
```
