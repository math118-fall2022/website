In this application exercise, we will once again using the `parkinsons` data you are so familiar with. We will build a model for a person's `hnr`.

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(broom)
parkinsons <- read.csv("data/parkinsons.csv")
```

### Exercise 1

Fit a linear regression model to predict `hnr` given the person's voice jitter, shimmer, and whether or not they have parkinsons.


### Exercise 2

Store an augmented version of your model so you have both the fitted value and residual for each observation. 



### Exercise 3

Using the appropriate diagnostic plots, determine which of the four linear regression model conditions appear to be violated, and which appear to be met. Make sure to reference the correct plot for each condition.





### Exercise 4

Is there multicollinearity in the predictors?
