## The language of models

---

## Modeling

- We use models to...
  - understand relationships
  - assess differences
  - make predictions


- We will focus on .vocab[linear] models but there are many other types.

# Data: Teacher salaries

---

## Teacher salaries

This data set contains teacher salaries from 2009-2010 for 71 teachers employed by the St. Louis Public School in Michigan.

```{r message=FALSE, echo= F}
data("teacher")
set.seed(1)
grade <- sample(c(rep("elementary", 20), rep("middle", 25), rep("high", 26)))
teacher <- teacher %>%
  mutate(degree = factor(degree, c("MA","BA")),
         grade = grade)
```

```{r}
glimpse(teacher)
```

---

## Data

- `degree`: highest educational degree attained (`"BA"` or `"MA"`)

- `fte`: full-time enrollment status (fulled time 1 or part-time 0.5)

- `years`: number of years employed by the school district

- `base`: base annual salary, in dollars

- `fica`: amount paid into Social Security and Medicare per year, in dollars

- `retirement`: amount paid into the retirement fund of the teacher per year, in dollars

- `total`: total annual salary of the teacher, resulting from the sum of `base` + `fica` + `retirement`, in dollars.

## Modeling the relationship between variables

---

## Describe the distribution of base

.midi[
```{r, fig.height = 2}
ggplot(data = teacher, aes(x = base)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 20) +
  labs(title="Distribution of base salary (in $)")
```
]

---

## Years and Degree

.pull-left[
```{r, fig.height = 4}
ggplot(data = teacher, aes(x = years)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 20) +
  theme(text = element_text(size = 20))
```
]

.pull-right[
```{r, fig.height = 4}
ggplot(data = teacher, aes(x = degree)) +
  geom_bar() +
  theme(text = element_text(size = 20))
```
]


---

## Models as functions

- We can represent relationships between variables using **functions**

- A .vocab[function] in the *mathematical* sense is the relationship between one or more inputs and an output created from those inputs. 
    - Plug in the inputs and receive back the output
    
--

- The formula $y = 3x + 7$ is a function with input $x$ and output $y$.
  - When $x$ is $5$, the output $y$ is $22$
    
    ```
    y = 3 * 5 + 7 = 22
    ```
    
--

  - When $x$ is $12$, the output of $y$ is $43$
  
    ```
    y = 3 * 12 + 7 = 43
    ```

---

## Visualizing the linear model

.midi[
```{r warning = FALSE, fig.height = 2}
ggplot(data = teacher, aes(x = years, y = base)) +
  geom_point() +
  ggtitle("Base salary vs years") +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm")  #<<
```
]

## Visualizing the linear model

.midi[
```{r warning = FALSE, fig.height = 2}
ggplot(data = teacher, aes(x = years, y = base)) +
  geom_point() +
  ggtitle("Base salary vs years") +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE, #<<
              col = "red", lty = 2, lwd = 1) #<<
```
]

---

## Vocabulary

- .vocab[Response variable]: Variable whose behavior or variation you are trying to understand, on the y-axis. Also called the **dependent variable**.

- .vocab[Explanatory variables]: Other variables that you want to use to explain the variation in the response, on the x-axis. Also called **independent variables**, **predictors**, or **features**.

--

.question[What might be the dependent and explanatory variables in our `teacher` data?]

--

- .vocab[Predicted value]:</font> Output of the **model function**
    - The model function gives the typical value of the response variable
    *conditioning* on the explanatory variables (what does this mean?)

---

## Vocabulary

- .vocab[Residuals]: Shows how far each case is from its predicted value
   - **Residual = Observed value - Predicted value**
   - Tells how far above/below the model function each case is

---

.question[
What does a positive residual mean? Which salaries on the plot have positive residuals, those below or above the line?
]

```{r warning = FALSE, echo=FALSE, fig.height = 2}
ggplot(data = teacher, aes(x = years, y = base)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE)
```

---

## Residuals

```{r warning = FALSE, fig.height=2.25, fig.width=5 ,echo = FALSE}
mod <- lm(base ~ years, data  = teacher)
x <- 13
y_true <- teacher$base[teacher$years==x]
y_pred <- predict(mod, newdata = data.frame(years = x))
ggplot(data = teacher, aes(x = years, y = base)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE, 
              col = "blue", lty = 1, lwd = 1) + 
  geom_point(aes(x = x, y = y_true), col = "red", shape = 1, size = 4)
```

---

## Residuals

- True salary when years = 13: 61216

- Predicted salary when years = 13: 54108.45 

```{r warning = FALSE, fig.height=2.25, fig.width=5 ,echo = FALSE}
lab <- paste0(y_true, " - ", round(y_pred,2), " = ", y_true - round(y_pred,2))
ggplot(data = teacher, aes(x = years, y = base)) +

```

## Residuals

- True salary when years = 34: 65360

- Predicted salary when years = 34: 70973.64 

```{r warning = FALSE, fig.height=2.25, fig.width=5 ,echo = FALSE}

  annotate("text", x  = x, y = y_true - 5000, label = "120 -  71.55 = 48.45", color = "pink", size = 4)
```

---

## Degree

.question[
How, if at all, does the relationship between `years` teaching and `base` salary of a teacher vary by whether they have a BA or MA?
]

```{r warning = FALSE, echo = F, fig.height=2}
ggplot(data = teacher, aes(x = years, y = base, 
                      color = factor(degree))) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.4) +
  # geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE) +
  labs(color = "Degree")
```

---

## Degree

.question[
How, if at all, does the relationship between `years` teaching and `base` salary of a teacher vary by whether they have a BA or MA?
]

```{r warning = FALSE, echo = F, fig.height=2}
ggplot(data = teacher, aes(x = years, y = base, 
                      color = factor(degree))) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.4) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE) +
  labs(color = "Degree")
```

---

## Models - upsides and downsides

- Models can sometimes reveal patterns that are not evident in a graph of the
data. This is a great advantage of modeling over simple visual inspection of
data. 

- There is a real risk, however, that a model is imposing structure that is
not really there on the scatter of data, just as people imagine animal shapes in
the stars. A skeptical approach is always warranted.

---

## Variation around the model...

is just as important as the model, if not more!

.question[
*Statistics is the explanation of variation in the context of what remains
unexplained.*
]

- The scatter suggests that there might be other factors that account for large parts 
of salary-to-salary variability, or perhaps just that randomness plays a big role.

- Adding more explanatory variables to a model can sometimes usefully reduce
the size of the scatter around the model. (We'll talk more about this later.)

---

## How do we use models?

1. .vocab[Explanation:] Characterize the relationship between $y$ and $x$ via *slopes* for
numerical explanatory variables or *differences* for categorical explanatory
variables

2. .vocab[Prediction:] Plug in $x$, get the predicted $y$

## Years and base salary

.midi[
```{r}
mod_years <- lm(base ~ years, data = teacher)
tidy(mod_years)
```
]

--

$$\widehat{baseSalary} = \color{blue}{43668} + \color{orange}{803}\times years$$

--

- .vocab[Slope]: For each additional year a teacher is employed at the school district, the base salary is expected
to be *higher*, on average, by $\color{orange}{803}$ dollars.

--

- .vocab[Intercept]: Teachers that have worked 0 years in the district are expected to have a base salary of $\color{blue}{43668}$ dollars,
on average.
    - Does this make sense?
   
--

- Why is there a "hat" on the response variable?

---

## The linear model with a single predictor

- We're interested in the $\beta_0$ (population parameter for the intercept)
and the $\beta_1$ (population parameter for the slope) in the 
following model:

$$ \hat{y} = \beta_0 + \beta_1~x $$

$\beta_1$ is often called the .vocab[coefficient] for the predictor variable $x$

--

- Unfortunately, we can't get these values

--

- So we use sample statistics to estimate them:

$$ \hat{y} = b_0 + b_1~x $$

---

## Least squares regression

The regression line minimizes the sum of squared residuals.

--

- .vocab[Residuals]: </font> $e_i = y_i - \hat{y}_i$,


- The regression line minimizes $\sum_{i = 1}^n e_i^2$.

- Equivalently, minimizing $\sum_{i = 1}^n [y_i - (b_0 + b_1~x_i)]^2$

.question[
Why do we minimize the *squares* of the residuals?
]

---

## Visualizing residuals

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.height = 2.5}
d <- tibble(
    base     = mod_years$model$base,
    years    = mod_years$model$years,
    pred         = mod_years$fitted.values,
    res          = mod_years$residuals
  )
p <- ggplot(data = d, mapping = aes(x = years, y = base)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.2) + 
  theme_bw() +
  labs(title = "Years vs. salary of teachers", subtitle = "Just the data",
       y = "base salary") 
p
```

---

## Visualizing residuals (cont.)

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.height= 2.5}
p <- p + 
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(y = pred)) +
  labs(subtitle = "Data + least squares regression line")
p
```

---

## Visualizing residuals (cont.)

```{r echo = FALSE, fig.height= 2.5}
p + 
  geom_segment(mapping = aes(xend = years, yend = pred), alpha = 0.4, color="orange") +
  labs(subtitle = "Data + least squares regression line + residuals")
```

# Prediction with models

---

## Predict base salary from years

.question[
On average, how much does a teacher in this district make if they have worked for 15 years?
$$\widehat{baseSalary} = 43668.1 + 803.1\times years$$
]

--

Let's just plug in 15 for $years$:

```{r}
43668.1  + 803.1 * 15
```

"On average, we expect paintings that a teacher who has been employed for 15 years to have a base salary of $55714.60."

**Warning:** We "expect" this to happen, but there will be some variability.

---

## Prediction vs. extrapolation

.question[
On average, what is the base salary for someone who has worked 80 years?
]

```{r extrapolate, warning = FALSE, echo=FALSE, fig.height = 2}
newdata <- tibble(years = 80)
newdata <- newdata %>%
  mutate(base = predict(mod_years, newdata = newdata))
ggplot(data = teacher, aes(x = years, y = base)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.4) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", fullrange = TRUE, se = FALSE) +
  # xlim(0, 420) +
  # ylim(0, 320) +
  geom_segment(data = newdata, mapping = aes(x = years, y = 0, xend = years, yend = base), color = "red", lty = 2) +
  geom_segment(data = newdata, mapping = aes(x =years, y = base, xend = 0, yend = base), color = "red", lty = 2)
```

---

## Watch out for extrapolation!

> "When those blizzards hit the East Coast this winter, it proved to my satisfaction 
that global warming was a fraud. That snow was freezing cold. But in an alarming 
trend, temperatures this spring have risen. Consider this: On February 6th it was 10 
degrees. Today it hit almost 80. At this rate, by August it will be 220 degrees. So 
clearly folks the climate debate rages on."<sup>1</sup>  <br>

## Categorical Predictors

---

## What about non-continuous predictors?

```{r echo=FALSE}
teacher %>% 
  select(degree, grade) %>% 
  slice(1:8)
```

---

## Categorical predictor with 2 levels

Height & landscape features

```{r}
mod_degree <- lm(base ~ degree, data = teacher)
tidy(mod_degree)
```

--

<br>

$$\widehat{baseSalary} = 56610 - 352\times degreeBA$$

---

## (cont.)

$$\widehat{baseSalary} = 56610 \color{orange}{- 352}\times degreeBA$$


- .vocab[Slope:] Teachers with a BA are expected, on average,
to have a base salary $\color{orange}{352}$ dollars *less* than teachers with an MA
    - Compares baseline level (`degreeMA`) to other level
    (`degreeBA`).

- .vocab[Intercept:] Teachers with an MA are expected, on 
average, to have a base salary of 56610 dollars

---



### Categorical predictors with more than 2 levels

.midi[
```{r}
mod_grade <- lm(base ~ grade, data = teacher)
tidy(mod_grade)
```
]

.question[
What do these rows correspond to? Why are there only two `grade`s listed, but we know there are three total?)
]

---

### Categorical predictors with more than 2 levels

.midi[
```{r echo = F}
mod_grade <- lm(base ~ grade, data = teacher)
tidy(mod_grade)
```
]

- When the categorical explanatory variable has many levels, the levels are encoded 
to .vocab[dummy variables]

- Each coefficient describes the expected difference between `base` salaries in that particular `grade` level compared to the baseline level.


---

## How dummy variables are made

```{r echo=FALSE}
teacher %>% 
  select(grade) %>% 
  group_by(grade) %>% 
  sample_n(1) %>%
  mutate(
    elementary = as.integer(ifelse(grade == "elementary", 1L, 0)),
    middle    = as.integer(ifelse(grade == "middle", 1L, 0)),
    high    = as.integer(ifelse(grade == "high", 1L, 0))
  )
```

## Tidy vs. not-so-tidy regression output

Let's revisit this model:

```{r}
mod_years <- lm(base ~ years, data = teacher)
```

---

## Not-so-tidy regression output

- You might come across these in your googling adventures, but we'll try to stay away from them

- Not because they are wrong, but because they don't result in tidy data frames as results.

---

## Not-so-tidy regression output (1)

**Option 1:**

```{r}
mod_years
```

---

##  Not-so-tidy regression output (2)

**Option 2:**

```{r}
summary(mod_years)
```

---

## Review

.question[
What makes a data frame tidy?
]

--

1. Each variable must have its own column.
2. Each observation must have its own row.
3. Each value must have its own cell.

---

## Tidy regression output

Achieved with functions from the broom package:

- .vocab[`tidy`]: Constructs a data frame that summarizes the model's statistical findings. We've talked about coefficient estimates and standard errors, but it also displays *test statistics and p-values* (more on these in a few weeks!).

- .vocab[`augment`]: Adds columns to the original data that was modeled. This includes predictions and residuals.

- .vocab[`glance`]: Constructs a concise one-row summary of the model, computed once for the entire model. 

---

## Tidy your model's statistical findings

```{r}
tidy(mod_years)
```

## Tidy your model's statistical findings
