## Installing R

Please be patient! This process may be time-consuming and stressful, but it is necessary for the rest of the course!

1. Go to the CRAN website at http://lib.stat.cmu.edu/R/CRAN/ and click on the appropriate link under "Download and Install R"

  a. If you are Windows, click "Install R for the first time", then "Download R-4.2.1 for Windows"
  
  b. If you use a Mac, check your Mac OS system (Apple icon -> About this Mac -> Overview -> Version xxx). Then on the website, click the newest release that supports your current OS version. For example, if I have Version 10.14.6, I will choose the "R-3.6.3.nnpkg" because is it "for OS X 10.11 (El Capitan) and higher, whereas the next version is for macOS 11.
  

2. A file will download (most likely to your *Downloads* folder). Run the file by clicking on it. Allow the app to make changes to your device if prompted.

3. Follow the installation instructions, until you click on "Finish" to exit the installation setup.
