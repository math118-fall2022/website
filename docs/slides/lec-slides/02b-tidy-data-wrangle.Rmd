# Identifying variables

---

## Number of variables involved

- .vocab[Univariate data analysis]: distribution of single variable

- .vocab[Bivariate data analysis]: relationship between two variables

- .vocab[Multivariate data analysis]: relationship between many variables at once, usually focusing on the relationship between two while conditioning for others

---

## Types of variables

- .vocab[Numerical variables] can be classified as .vocab[continuous] or .vocab[discrete] based on whether or not the variable can take on an infinite number of values or only non-negative whole numbers, respectively.
    - *height* is continuous
    - *number of siblings* is discrete

--

- If the variable is .vocab[categorical], we can determine if it is .vocab[ordinal] based on whether or not the levels have a natural ordering.
    - *hair color* is unordered 
    - *year in school* is ordinal

# Visualizing numerical data

---

### Describing shapes of numerical distributions

- **shape:**
    - skewness: right-skewed, left-skewed, symmetric (skew is to the side of the longer tail)
    - modality: unimodal, bimodal, multimodal, uniform
    
- **center:** mean (**`mean`**), median (**`median`**), mode (not always useful)

- **spread:** range (**`range`**), standard deviation (**`sd`**), inter-quartile range (**`IQR`**)

- **outliers**: observations outside of the usual pattern

---

## Histograms

.small[
```{r fig.width = 7, fig.height = 4, fig.align='center'}
ggplot(data = starwars, mapping = aes(x = height)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 10)
```
]

---

## Density plots

.small[
```{r fig.width = 7, fig.height=4, fig.align='center'}
ggplot(data = starwars, mapping = aes(x = height)) +
  geom_density()
```
]

---

## Side-by-side box plots

.small[
```{r echo = F}
starwars <- starwars %>%
  mutate(hair_color2 = case_when(
    hair_color == "black" ~ "black", 
    hair_color == "brown" ~ "brown", 
    hair_color == "none" ~ "none", 
    TRUE ~ "other"), 
         eye_color2 = case_when(
           eye_color == "brown" ~ "brown", 
           eye_color == "blue" ~ "blue", 
           eye_color == "yellow" ~ "yellow",

ggplot(data = starwars, mapping = aes(x = eye_color2)) +
  geom_bar()
```

---

### Segmented bar plots, counts

.small[
```{r fig.width = 7, fig.height=4, fig.align='center'}

---

.question[
Which bar plot is a more useful representation for visualizing the relationship between eye color and hair color? Why?
]

.pull-left[

```{r echo=FALSE,fig.height=6, fig.width=6}

ggplot(data = starwars, mapping = aes(x = eye_color2, fill = hair_color2)) +

.pull-left[
**Characteristics of tidy data:**

- Each variable forms a column.
- Each observation forms a row.
- Each type of observational unit forms a table.
]

.pull-right[
**Characteristics of untidy data:**

!@#$%^&*()
]

## Summary tables 

.question[
Is each of the following a dataset? Which is a summary table?
]

.small[
.pull-left[
```{r echo=FALSE}
starwars %>%
  select(name, height, mass)
```
]

.pull-right[
```{r echo=FALSE}
starwars %>%
  group_by(species) %>%
  summarize(avg_height = round(mean(height, na.rm = TRUE), 2)) %>%
  slice(1:10)
```

# Pipes

---

### Where does the name come from?

The pipe operator is implemented in the package **magrittr**, it's pronounced "and then".

.pull-left[
![pipe](img/02b/magritte.jpg)
]
.pull-right[
![magrittr](img/02b/magrittr.jpg)
]

.small[
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Treachery_of_Images](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Treachery_of_Images)
]  

---

## Review: How does a pipe work?

- You can think about the following sequence of actions - find key, 
unlock car, start car, drive to school, park.
- Expressed as a set of nested functions in R pseudocode this would look like:
```{r eval=FALSE}
park(drive(start_car(find("keys")), to = "campus"))
```

--

- Writing it out using pipes give it a more natural (and easier to read) 
structure:
```{r eval=FALSE}
find("keys") %>%
  start_car() %>%
  drive(to = "campus") %>%
  park()
```

---

## What about other arguments?

To send results to a function argument other than first one or to use the previous result for multiple arguments, use "`.`"

```{r fig.height=1.8, fig.width = 3.75}
starwars %>%
  filter(species == "Human") %>%
  lm(mass ~ height, data = .)
```

# Data wrangling

---

## Bike crashes in NC 2007 - 2014

The dataset is in the **dsbox** package:

```{r load-data, eval=FALSE}
library(dsbox)
ncbikecrash
```

- The dataset contains all North Carolina bike crash data from 2007-2014. 
- Data downloaded on Sep 6, 2018.

---

## Variables

View the names of variables via

.tiny[
```{r}
names(ncbikecrash)
```
]

and see detailed descriptions with `?ncbikecrash`.

---

## Viewing your data

- In the Environment, after loading with `data(ncbikecrash)`, and click on the 
name of the data frame to view it in the data viewer
- Use the `glimpse` function to take a peek

```{r}
glimpse(ncbikecrash)
```

### A Grammar of Data Manipulation

**dplyr** is based on the concepts of functions as verbs that manipulate data frames.

.pull-left[
![](img/02b/dplyr-part-of-tidyverse.png)
]

.pull-right[
.tiny[
- `filter`: pick rows matching criteria
- `slice`: pick rows using index(es)
- `select`: pick columns by name
- `pull`: grab a column as a vector
- `arrange`: reorder rows
]
]

---

### A Grammar of Data Manipulation

**dplyr** is based on the concepts of functions as verbs that manipulate data frames.

.pull-left[
![](img/02b/dplyr-part-of-tidyverse.png)
]

.pull-right[
.tiny[
- `mutate`: add new variables
- `distinct`: filter for unique rows
- `sample_n` / `sample_frac`: randomly sample rows
- `summarise`: reduce variables to values
- ... (many more)
]
]

---

## **dplyr** rules for functions

- First argument is *always* a data frame

- Subsequent arguments say what to do with that data frame

- Always returns a data frame

---

## A note on piping and layering

- The `%>%` operator in **dplyr** functions is called the **pipe operator**. This means you "pipe" the output of the previous line of code as the first input of the next line of code.

<br>

- The `+` operator in **ggplot2** functions is used for "layering". This means you create the plot in layers, separated by `+`.

---

### `filter` to select a subset of rows

for crashes in Durham County

```{r}
ncbikecrash %>%
  filter(county == "Durham") #<<
```

---

### `filter` for many conditions at once

for crashes in Durham County where biker was 30-39 years old

```{r}
ncbikecrash %>%
  filter(county == "Durham", bike_age_group == "30-39") #<<
```

---

### Logical operators in R

operator    | definition                   || operator     | definition
------------|------------------------------||--------------|----------------
`<`         | less than                    ||`x`&nbsp;&#124;&nbsp;`y`     | `x` OR `y` 
`<=`        |	less than or equal to        ||`is.na(x)`    | test if `x` is `NA`
`>`         | greater than                 ||`!is.na(x)`   | test if `x` is not `NA`
`>=`        |	greater than or equal to     ||`x %in% y`    | test if `x` is in `y`
`==`        |	exactly equal to             ||`!(x %in% y)` | test if `x` is not in `y`
`!=`        |	not equal to                 ||`!x`          | not `x`
`x & y`     | `x` AND `y`                  ||              |

---

### `select` to keep variables

```{r}
ncbikecrash %>%
  filter(county == "Durham", bike_age_group == "30-39") %>%
  select(locality, speed_limit) #<<
```

---

### `select` to exclude variables

```{r}
ncbikecrash %>%
  select(-object_id) #<<
```

---

### `select` a range of variables

```{r}
ncbikecrash %>%
  select(city:locality) #<<
```

---

### `slice` for certain row numbers

First five rows 

```{r}
ncbikecrash %>%
  slice(1:5) #<<
```

---

### `slice` for certain row numbers

Last five rows

```{r}
last_row <- nrow(ncbikecrash)
ncbikecrash %>%
  slice((last_row - 4):last_row) #<<
```

---

### `pull` to extract a column as a vector

```{r}
ncbikecrash %>%
  slice(1:6) %>%
  pull(locality) #<<
```

--

vs.

```{r}
ncbikecrash %>%
  slice(1:6) %>%
  select(locality) #<<
```

---

### `sample_n` / `sample_frac` for a random sample

- `sample_n`: randomly sample 5 observations

```{r}
ncbikecrash_n5 <- ncbikecrash %>%
  sample_n(5, replace = FALSE) #<<
dim(ncbikecrash_n5)
```

--

- `sample_frac`: randomly sample 20% of observations

```{r}
ncbikecrash_perc20 <-ncbikecrash %>%
  sample_frac(0.2, replace = FALSE) #<<
dim(ncbikecrash_perc20)
```

---

### `distinct` to filter for unique rows

And `arrange` to order alphabetically

```{r}
ncbikecrash %>% 
  select(county, city) %>% 
  distinct() %>% 
  arrange(county, city) #<<
```

---

### `summarise` to reduce variables to values

```{r}
ncbikecrash %>%
  summarise(avg_hr = mean(crash_hour)) #<<
```

---

### `group_by` to do calculations on groups

```{r}
ncbikecrash %>%
  group_by(hit_run) %>% #<<
  summarise(avg_hr = mean(crash_hour))
```

---

### `count` observations in groups

```{r}
ncbikecrash %>%
  count(driver_alcohol_drugs) #<<
```

---

### `mutate` to add new variables

.small[
```{r eval=FALSE}
ncbikecrash %>% 
  mutate(driver_alcohol_drugs_simplified = case_when(
    is.na(driver_alcohol_drugs)             ~ driver_alcohol_drugs,
    driver_alcohol_drugs == "Missing"       ~ NA_character_,
    str_detect(driver_alcohol_drugs, "Yes") ~ "Yes",
    TRUE                                    ~ "No"
  ))
```
]
---

### "Save" when you `mutate`

Most often when you define a new variable with `mutate` you'll also want to save the resulting data frame, often by writing over the original data frame.

```{r}
ncbikecrash <- ncbikecrash %>% #<<
  mutate(driver_alcohol_drugs_simplified = case_when(
    is.na(driver_alcohol_drugs)             ~ driver_alcohol_drugs,
    driver_alcohol_drugs == "Missing"       ~ NA_character_,
    str_detect(driver_alcohol_drugs, "Yes") ~ "Yes",
    TRUE                                    ~ "No"
  ))
```

---

### Check before you move on

```{r}
ncbikecrash %>% 
  count(driver_alcohol_drugs, driver_alcohol_drugs_simplified)
```

```{r}
ncbikecrash %>% 
  count(driver_alcohol_drugs_simplified)
```
