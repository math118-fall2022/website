### Hypothesis testing framework

- Start with a null hypothesis, $H_0$, that represents the status quo

- Set an alternative hypothesis, $H_A$, that represents the research question, 
i.e. what weâ€™re testing for

- Conduct a hypothesis test under the assumption that the null hypothesis is true and 
calculate a <font class="vocab">p-value</font> (probability of observed or more extreme outcome given that the 
null hypothesis is true)
    - if the test results suggest that the data do not provide convincing evidence for 
    the alternative hypothesis, stick with the null hypothesis
    - if they do, then reject the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative

### Is yawning contagious?

An experiment conducted by the MythBusters tested if a person can be subconsciously influenced into yawning if another person near them yawns.

[https://www.discovery.com/tv-shows/mythbusters/videos/is-yawning-contagious-2](https://www.discovery.com/tv-shows/mythbusters/videos/is-yawning-contagious-2)

.question[
**Do we buy their conclusion?**
]

---

### Study description

In this study 50 people were randomly assigned to two groups: 34 to a group where a person near them yawned (treatment) and 16 to a control group where they didn't see someone yawn (control).

```{r message=FALSE}
mb_yawn <- read_csv("data/mb-yawn.csv")
```

```{r}
mb_yawn %>%
  count(group, outcome)
```

---

### Proportion of yawners

.small[
```{r}
mb_yawn %>%
  count(group, outcome) %>%
  group_by(group) %>%
  mutate(p_hat = n / sum(n))
```
]

- Proportion of yawners in the treatment group: $\frac{10}{34} = 0.2941$
- Proportion of yawners in the control group: $\frac{4}{16} = 0.25$
- Difference: $0.2941 - 0.25 = 0.0441$
- Our results match the ones calculated on the MythBusters episode.

---

### Independence?

.question[
Based on the proportions we calculated, 
do you think yawning is really contagious, i.e. are seeing someone yawn 
and yawning dependent?
]

```{r echo=FALSE}
mb_yawn %>%
  count(group, outcome) %>%
  group_by(group) %>%
  mutate(p_hat = n / sum(n))
```

---

### Dependence, or another possible explanation?

- The observed differences might suggest that yawning is contagious, i.e. seeing someone yawn 
and yawning are dependent.

- But the differences are small enough that we might wonder if they might simple be **due to chance**.

- Perhaps if we were to repeat the experiment, we would see slightly different results.

- So we will do just that - well, somewhat - and see what happens.

- Instead of actually conducting the experiment many times, we will **simulate** our results.

---

### Two competing claims

- "There is nothing going on." 
Yawning and seeing someone yawn are <font class="vocab">independent</font>, yawning is not contagious, observed difference in proportions is simply due to chance. $\rightarrow$ Null hypothesis

- "There is something going on."
Yawning and seeing someone yawn are <font class="vocab">dependent</font>, yawning is contagious, observed difference in proportions is not due to chance. $\rightarrow$ Alternative hypothesis

---

### Simulation setup

1. A regular deck of cards is comprised of 52 cards: 4 aces, 4 of numbers 2-10, 4 jacks, 4 queens, and 4 kings.

2. Take out two aces from the deck of cards and set them aside.
    - Take out Jokers if you have them.

3. The remaining 50 playing cards to represent each participant in the study:
    - 14 face cards (including the 2 aces) represent the people who yawn.
    - 36 non-face cards represent the people who don't yawn.

---

### Running the simulation

1. Shuffle the 50 cards at least 7 times<sup>1</sup> to ensure that the cards counted out are from a random process.

2. Count out the top 16 cards and set them aside. These cards represent the people in the control group.

3. Out of the remaining 34 cards (treatment group) count the <font color="red">number of face cards</font> (the number of people who yawned in the treatment group).

4. Calculate the difference in proportions of yawners (treatment - control). 

5. Send one group member to the front of the room to input your group's difference in proportions.

    + P(Type 2 error) is harder to calculate, but increases as $\alpha$ decreases

### Hypothesis testing for a single numeric variable

Let's go back to the price to rent a one-bedroom apartment in Manhattan. 

```{r message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
manhattan <- read_csv("data/manhattan.csv")
```

.small[
.pull-left[
```{r}
manhattan %>% slice(1:10)
```
]
.pull-right[
```{r}
manhattan %>% slice(11:20)
```
]

### Rent in Manhattan

```{r}
manhattan %>% summarise(mean=mean(rent))
```

.question[
According to the site Rent Jungle, the average price to rent an apartment in LA is around $2400. Is the average rent for a one-bedroom in Manhattan significantly different from $2400?

### Simulation process

We will use bootstrapping to generate a sampling distribution under the assumption of the null hypothesis being true. Then, calculate the p-value to make a decision on the hypotheses.

1. Take a bootstrap sample - a random sample taken with replacement from the original sample, of the same size as the original sample.

2. Calculate the mean of the bootstrap sample.

3. Repeat steps (1) and (2) many times to create a bootstrap distribution - a distribution of bootstrap means.

4. Shift the bootstrap distribution to be centered at the null value by subtracting/adding the difference between the center of the bootstrap distribution and the null value to each bootstrap mean.

5. Calculate the p-value as the proportion of simulations that yield a sample mean at least as extreme as the observed sample mean.

---

### Part 1:  Take Bootstrap Sample

Take a bootstrap sample - a random sample taken with replacement from the original sample, of the same size as the original sample

.small[
```{r}
rent_bootstrap <- manhattan %>%
  specify(response = "rent") %>%
  generate(reps = 1000, type = "bootstrap") %>%
  calculate(stat = "mean")
```
]

---

### Part 1:  Take Bootstrap Sample

```{r echo=F, warning = F, message = F, fig.height = 3}
ggplot(data = rent_bootstrap, mapping = aes(x = stat)) +
  geom_histogram() +
  labs(title = "Bootstrap distribution")
```

.question[Where is the center of the distribution? What should it be under the null hypothesis?]

---

### Part 2: Shift Distribution 

Shift the bootstrap distribution to be centered at the null value by subtracting/adding the difference between the center of the bootstrap distribution and the null value to each bootstrap mean.

```{r}
rent_boot_mean <- rent_bootstrap %>%
  summarise(mean = mean(stat)) %>% pull()

  
rent_bootstrap <- rent_bootstrap %>%
  mutate(null_dist_stat = stat - (rent_boot_mean - 2400))
```

---

### Part 2: Shift Distribution 

```{r echo=F, warning = F, message = F, fig.height = 3}
ggplot(data = rent_bootstrap, mapping = aes(x = null_dist_stat)) +
  geom_histogram() +
  labs(title = "Bootstrap distribution")
```

---

### Part 3: Calculate P-value 

.question[
How should we calculate the p-value?
]

```{r echo=F, warning = F, message = F, fig.height = 3}
ggplot(data = rent_bootstrap, mapping = aes(x = null_dist_stat)) +
  geom_histogram() +
  labs(title = "Bootstrap distribution")
```

---

### Part 3: Calculate p-value 

Use the results below  to calculate p-value: 

```{r}
rent_bootstrap %>%
  count(null_dist_stat > 2625.8) 
```
