# Scraping the web

---

## Scraping the web: what? why?

- Increasing amount of data is available on the web
--

- These data are provided in an unstructured format: you can always copy&amp;paste, 
but it's time-consuming and prone to errors

--

- Web scraping is the process of extracting this information automatically and transform it into a structured dataset

--

- Two different scenarios:
    - Screen scraping: extract data from source code of website, with html 
    parser (easy) or regular expression matching (less easy).
    - Web APIs (application programming interface): website offers a set of 
    structured http requests that return JSON or XML files.

# Web Scraping with rvest

---

## Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)

.midi[
- HTML describes the structure of a web page; your browser interprets the 
  structure and contents and displays the results.
  
- The basic building blocks include elements, tags, and attributes.
    - an element is a component of an HTML document
    - elements contain tags (start and end tag)
    - attributes provide additional information about HTML elements
]

## Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)

&lt;img src="img/25/html-structure.png" width="70%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

---

## Simple HTML document

```html
&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
&lt;title&gt;Web Scraping&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Using rvest&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To get started...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
```

--

We can visualize this in a tree-like structure.

### If we have access to an HTML document, then how can we easily extract information and get it in a format that's useful for anlaysis? 

---

## rvest

.pull-left[
- The **rvest** package makes basic processing and manipulation of HTML data straight forward
- It's designed to work with pipelines built with `%&gt;%`
]
.pull-right[
&lt;img src="img/25/rvest.png" width="230" style="display: block; margin: auto 0 auto auto;" /&gt;
]

---

## Core rvest functions

- `read_html`   - Read HTML data from a url or character string
- `html_node `  - Select a specified node from HTML document
- `html_nodes`  - Select specified nodes from HTML document
- `html_table`  - Parse an HTML table into a data frame
- `html_text`   - Extract tag pairs' content
- `html_name`   - Extract tags' names
- `html_attrs`  - Extract all of each tag's attributes
- `html_attr`   - Extract tags' attribute value by name

---

## Example: simple_html

Let's suppose we have the following HTML document from the example website with the URL `simple_html`

```html 
&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
&lt;title&gt;Web Scraping&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Using rvest&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To get started...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
```



---

## HTML in R

Read in the document with `read_html()`.


```r
page &lt;- read_html(simple_html) #replace with URL in practice
```

--

What does this look like?

--


```r
page
```

```
## {html_document}
## &lt;html&gt;
## [1] &lt;head&gt;\n&lt;meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8 ...
## [2] &lt;body&gt;\n&lt;h1&gt;Using rvest&lt;/h1&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;To get started...&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/body&gt;
```

---

## Subset with `html_nodes()`

Let's extract the highlighted component below.

.small[

```r
&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
&lt;title&gt;Web Scraping&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
*&lt;h1&gt;Using rvest&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To get started...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
```
]
--

.midi[

```r
h1_nodes &lt;-page %&gt;%
  html_nodes(css = "h1")
h1_nodes
```

```
## {xml_nodeset (1)}
## [1] &lt;h1&gt;Using rvest&lt;/h1&gt;
```
]
---

## Extract contents and tag name

Let's extract "Using rvest" and `h1`.

.small[

```r
&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
&lt;title&gt;Web Scraping&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
*&lt;h1&gt;Using rvest&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To get started...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
```
]
--

.pull-left[
.midi[

```r
h1_nodes %&gt;% 
  html_text()
```

```
## [1] "Using rvest"
```
]
]

.pull-right[
.midi[

```r
h1_nodes %&gt;% 
  html_name()
```

```
## [1] "h1"
```
]
]
---

## Scaling up

Most HTML documents are not as simple as what we just examined. There may be tables, hundreds of links, paragraphs of text, and more. Naturally, we may wonder:

1. How do we handle larger HTML documents? 

2. How do we know what to provide to `css` in function `html_nodes()` when
   we attempt to subset the HTML document?
   
3. Are these functions in `rvest` vectorized? For instance, are we able to get 
   all the content in the `td` tags on the slide that follows?

In Chrome, you can view the HTML document associated with a web page by going
to `View &gt; Developer &gt; View Source`.

## SelectorGadget

.pull-left[
- Open source tool that eases CSS selector generation and discovery
- Easiest to use with the [Chrome Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/selectorgadget/mhjhnkcfbdhnjickkkdbjoemdmbfginb) 
- Find out more on the [SelectorGadget vignette](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rvest/vignettes/selectorgadget.html)
]
.pull-right[
&lt;img src="img/25/selector-gadget.png" width="1901" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;
]

---

## Using the SelectorGadget

.pull-left[
- .midi[Click on the app logo next to the search bar. A box will open in the bottom right of the website.]
- .midi[Click on a page element (it will turn green), SelectorGadget will generate a minimal CSS selector for that element, and will highlight (yellow) everything that is matched by the selector.]
]

.pull-right[
&lt;img src="img/25/selector-gadget.gif" height="250" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;
]


- .midi[Click on a highlighted element to remove it from the selector (red), or click on an unhighlighted element to add it to the selector.]

- .midi[Through this process of selection and rejection, SelectorGadget helps you come up with the appropriate CSS selector for your needs.]

## Top 250 movies on IMDB

Take a look at the source code, look for the tag `table` tag:
&lt;br&gt;
http://www.imdb.com/chart/top

&lt;img src="img/25/imdb_top_250.png" width="60%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

## First check if you're allowed!


```r
library(robotstxt)
paths_allowed("http://www.imdb.com")
```

```
## [1] TRUE
```

vs. e.g.


```r
paths_allowed("http://www.facebook.com")
```

```
## [1] FALSE
```
