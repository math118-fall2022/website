# Intro to spatial visualization

---

## Spatial data is important

- exploratory data analysis
- detecting spatial patterns and trends
- understanding spatial data relationships
- analysis of spatial data should reflect spatial structure

---
## Context

- `R` is great for interactive data visualizations, but it is not the gold standard for spatial data viz

  - GIS is more commonly used for intensive spatial mapping (think layers)

- Packages such as `sf` and `rgdal` make it easier to create beautiful maps in `R`, but are not the most friendly for beginners

---

## 1854 London Cholera Outbreak

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="50%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/24/cholera.png")
```

---

## Spatial data 

- While it's often easier for us to understand longitude-latitude, this system is not used in real world mapping

- Instead, professionals use *vector* data that are encoded using "simple features"

  - The `sf` package developed by Edzer Pebesma provides an excellent toolset for working with such data

---

## Spatial data is different

Our typical tidy data frame:

.midi[
```{r}
nycflights13::flights
```
]

---

## Spatial data is different

Our (new) .vocab[simple feature] object:

.midi[
```{r echo=FALSE}
nc <- st_read("data/nc_votes.shp", quiet = TRUE)
nc %>% 
  select(name, regstrd, voted)
```
]

--

<br/>

**What differences do you observe?**

---

## Raster versus vector spatial data

.vocab[Vector] spatial data describes the world using shapes (points, lines, 
polygons, etc).

.vocab[Raster] spatial data describes the world using cells of constant size.  

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="35%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/24/vector_raster_comparison.png")
```

The choice to use vector or raster data depends on the problem context. We will focus on **vector** data.

---

## Simple features

```{r echo = T}
#install.packages("sf")
library(sf)
```

A .vocab[simple feature] is a standard way to describe how real-world 
spatial objects (country, building, tree, road, etc) can be represented by a computer. 

--

The package `sf` implements simple features and other spatial functionality using **tidy** principles.

---

## Simple features 

Simple features have a geometry type. Common choices are below.

```{r echo=FALSE}
pt <- st_point(c(30, 10))
ls <- st_linestring(matrix(c(30, 10, 10, 30, 40, 40), byrow = TRUE, ncol =
                            2))
poly <- st_polygon(list(matrix(
  c(30, 10, 40, 40, 20, 40, 10, 20, 30, 10),
  ncol = 2,
  byrow = TRUE
)))
poly_hole <- st_polygon(list(matrix(
  c(35, 10, 45, 45, 15, 40, 10, 20, 35, 10),
  ncol = 2,
  byrow = TRUE
),
matrix(
  c(20, 30, 35, 35, 30, 20, 20, 30),
  ncol = 2,
  byrow = TRUE
)))

pts <- st_multipoint(matrix(
  c(10, 40, 40, 30, 20, 20, 30, 10),
  ncol = 2,
  byrow = TRUE
))
lss <- st_multilinestring(list(matrix(
  c(10, 10, 20, 20, 10, 40), ncol = 2, byrow = TRUE
),
matrix(
  c(40, 40, 30, 30, 40, 20, 30, 10),
  ncol = 2,
  byrow = TRUE
)))
polys <- st_multipolygon(list(list(matrix(
  c(30, 20, 45, 40, 10, 40, 30, 20),
  ncol = 2,
  byrow = TRUE
)),
list(matrix(
  c(15, 5, 40, 10, 10, 20, 5, 10, 15, 5),
  ncol = 2,
  byrow = TRUE
))))
polys_hole <- st_multipolygon(list(list(matrix(
  c(40, 40, 20, 45, 45, 30, 40, 40),
  ncol = 2,
  byrow = TRUE
)),
list(
  matrix(
    c(20, 35, 10, 30, 10, 10, 30, 5, 45, 20, 20, 35),
    ncol = 2,
    byrow = TRUE
  ),
  matrix(
    c(30, 20, 20, 15, 20, 25, 30, 20),
    ncol = 2,
    byrow = TRUE
  )
)))
```

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.height = 5, fig.align="center"}
par(mar = c(1, 1, 2, 1), mfrow = c(4, 4))

plot(pt,
     axes = FALSE,
     main = "Point",
     pch = 16)
box()
plot(ls, axes = FALSE, main = "Linestring")
box()
plot(poly,
     axes = FALSE,
     col = "lightgrey",
     main = "Polygon")
box()
plot(poly_hole,
     axes = FALSE,
     col = "lightgrey",
     main = "Polygon w/ Hole(s)")
box()

plot(pts,
     axes = FALSE,
     main = "Multipoint",
     pch = 16)
box()
plot(lss, axes = FALSE, main = "Multilinestring")
box()
plot(polys,
     axes = FALSE,
     col = "lightgrey",
     main = "Multipolygon")
box()
plot(polys_hole,
     axes = FALSE,
     col = "lightgrey",
     main = "Multipolygon w/ Hole(s)")
box()
```

## A simple feature object

- Simple features are stored in a data frame, with the geographic information 
in a column called `geometry`

- Simple features can contain both spatial and non-spatial data

- Functions for spatial data in `sf` begin `st_`

# Visualizing spatial data

## `nc_votes`

This data was pulled from the [North Carolina Early Voting Statistics](https://electproject.github.io/Early-Vote-2020G/NC.html) website and
is through 10-28-2020.

The dataset contains the following variables:

- `name`: county name
- `regstrd`: number of registered voters
- `voted`: number of individuals who have voted
- `mailed`: number of mail ballots returned
- `rejectd`: number of mail ballots rejected
- `ml_rqst`: number of mail ballots requested

---

## Getting `sf` objects

To read simple features from a file or database use the function `st_read()`.

.small[
```{r}
library(sf)
nc <- st_read("data/nc_votes.shp", quiet = TRUE) #<<
nc
```
]

---

## Plotting with `ggplot()`

```{r fig.height=2}
ggplot(nc) + #<<
  geom_sf() + #<<
  labs(title = "North Carolina counties")
```

---

## A look at some aesthetics

```{r fig.height=2}
ggplot(nc) +
  geom_sf(color = "lightblue") + #<<
  labs(title = "North Carolina counties with theme and aesthetics") 
```


---

## A look at some aesthetics

```{r fig.height=2}
ggplot(nc) +
  geom_sf(color = "lightblue", size = 1.5) + #<<
  labs(title = "North Carolina counties with theme and aesthetics")
```

---

## A look at some aesthetics

```{r fig.height = 2}
ggplot(nc) +
  geom_sf(color = "lightblue", size = 1.5, fill = "purple") + #<<
  labs(title = "North Carolina counties with theme and aesthetics")
```
---

## A look back at some of our data

.small[
```{r echo=FALSE}
nc
```
]


Let's incorporate these variables into our plot using `ggplot`.

---

## Choropleth map

```{r choropleth-1-code, fig.height=2}
ggplot(nc) +
  geom_sf(aes(fill = voted)) + #<<
  labs(title = "Higher population counties have more votes cast",
       fill = "Total votes cast") 
```


It is sometimes helpful to pick diverging colors;
[colorbrewer2](http://colorbrewer2.org/#type=sequential&scheme=BuGn&n=3)
can help.


---

## Choropleth map: colors

One way to set fill colors is with `scale_fill_gradient()`.

```{r choropleth-2, eval = T, fig.height= 2}
ggplot(nc) +
  geom_sf(aes(fill = voted)) +
  scale_fill_gradient(low = "#fee8c8", high = "#7f0000") + #<<
  labs(title = "Higher population counties have more votes cast",
       fill = "Total votes cast") 
```

---

## Choropleth map: colors

- The `RColorBrewer` package provides fun color palettes for you

```{r RColorBrewer_code, eval = T, fig.height = 2}
library(RColorBrewer) 
ggplot(nc) +
  geom_sf(aes(fill = voted)) +
  scale_fill_gradientn(colors = brewer.pal(8, "Spectral")) + #<<
  labs(title = "Higher population counties have more votes cast", fill = "Total votes cast") 
```

---

## Adding labels

```{r map_label_error, fig.height = 2}
ggplot(nc) +
  geom_sf(aes(fill = voted)) +
  scale_fill_gradientn(colors = brewer.pal(8, "Spectral")) +
  geom_sf_text(data = nc %>% filter(voted > 300000), aes(label = name), #<<
               size = 2, col = "white")
```

---


## Let's make it more informative 


```{r choropleth-3-code, eval = F}
ggplot(nc) +
  geom_sf(aes(fill = voted/regstrd)) +#<<
  scale_fill_gradient(low = "#fff7f3", high = "#49006a") +
  labs(fill = "Votes cast per registered voter", 
       title = "Early vote turnout varies by county") +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom", legend.direction="horizontal") #<<
```

---

## Let's make it more informative 


```{r choropleth-3, echo = F, fig.height=3}
ggplot(nc) +
  geom_sf(aes(fill = voted/regstrd)) +
  scale_fill_gradient(low = "#fff7f3", high = "#49006a") +
  labs(fill = "Votes cast per registered voter", 
       title = "Early vote turnout varies by county") +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom", legend.direction="horizontal") 
```

## `us_states`

```{r echo = T}
library(sf)
library(spData) #this packages contains the dataset (with sf objects) that we will be using today 
data("us_states")
us_states
```

- The CRS is `NAD83`, which projects longitude-latitude coordinates. It is most commonly used by U.S. federal agencies. 

---

## Mapping states


```{r fig.height = 2}
ggplot(us_states) +
  geom_sf()
```

---

## Mapping with points!

- Recall the  `nycflights13`  dataset from the practice midterm which had all kinds information about all the flights out of NYC airports in 2013

```{r}
library(nycflights13)
data(airports)
```

- Let's try to plot these airports onto our map!

---

## Mapping airports

```{r us-airports-1, fig.height = 2}
ggplot(us_states) +
  geom_sf() +
  geom_point(data = airports, aes(x = lon, y = lat), size = 0.1) #<<
```

.question[What's happening here?]

---

## Mapping airports

```{r us-airports-2, fig.height=2}
ggplot(us_states) +
  geom_sf() +
  geom_point(data = airports, aes(x = lon, y = lat), pch = 19, size = 0.1) +
  coord_sf(xlim = c(-130, -65),  ylim = c(20, 50)) #<<
```

---

## Mapping airports

.alert[Recall that `airports` is a regular data frame. Why am I able to plot `airports` if it is not an `sf` object?]

---

## Making more informative

- What if we wanted each point to represent the number of flights that flew to those airports from NYC? 

- Need the data about flight info:

```{r}
data(flights)
dest_count <- flights %>%
  count(dest, name = "count") 
dest_count %>%
  slice(1:3)
```

---

## Making more informative (cont.)

- We will merge our new `dest_count` object with the original `airports` data frame:

```{r}
airports_count <- airports %>%  
  inner_join(dest_count, by=c("faa" = "dest"))
```

- Then we can add `airports_count` data to our plot!

```{r eval = F}
ggplot(us_states) +  
  geom_sf() + 
  coord_sf(xlim = c(-130, -65), ylim = c(20, 50)) +
  geom_point(data=airports_count, aes(x=lon, y=lat, size=count)) + #<<
  scale_size(range = c(0.2,5), breaks=c(0,1,10,100,1000,10000,100000))  #<<
```

---

## Making more informative (cont.)

```{r airports_count, echo = F}
ggplot(us_states) +  
  geom_sf() + 
  coord_sf(xlim = c(-130, -65), ylim = c(20, 50)) +
  geom_point(data=airports_count, aes(x=lon, y=lat, size=count)) + #<<
  scale_size(range = c(0.2,5), breaks=c(0,1,10,100,1000,10000,100000))  #<<
```

---


## Challenge 1

- Manipulating spatial data objects is similar, but not identical to manipulating
data frames. 

- Note the core data-wrangling functions from `dplyr` do work (we used `filter()`earlier!)

---

## Geometries are "sticky"

The geometry is kept until it is deliberated dropped using `st_drop_geometry`.

--

```{r}
nc %>% 
  select(name, regstrd) %>% 
  filter(regstrd > 100000) %>% 
  st_drop_geometry() #<<
```

---

## Challenge 2

The coordinate reference system (CRS) matters. The following is output from the `sf` object `nc`:

```{r eval=FALSE}
    Simple feature collection with 100 features and 6 fields
    Geometry type:  MULTIPOLYGON
    Dimension:      XY
    Bounding box:   xmin: -84.32385 ymin: 33.88199 xmax: -75.45698 ymax: 36.58965
    Geodetic CRS: NAD27 #<<
      name  regstrd  ...   geometry
    1 Ashe  19414    ...   <MULTIPOLYGON> (((-81.47276 36.23436, -81.54084 36.27251,  -...
```
