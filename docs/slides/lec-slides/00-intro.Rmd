## What is Data Science?

*"Data science is a concept to unify statistics, data analysis, machine learning and their related methods in order to understand and analyze actual phenomena with data. It employs techniques and theories drawn from many fields within the context of <font class="vocab">mathematics, statistics, information science, and computer science</font>."*

.pull-right[
[-Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_science)
]

We will be leveraging the programming language R to introduce ourselves to data science.
---


## Necessary background

We assume ZERO background in data science, statistics, and coding. We will help you get started with learning statistics, but this course will *not* be your typical intro stats course.

There is a large emphasis on computing, so we all we need is an openness to learn! (And a laptop)

## Your Turn!

---

## Create a GitHub account

<small>

<small>

.instructions[
Go to https://github.com/, and create an account (unless you already have one). After you create your account, click [here](https://forms.gle/xKD3bPtN6YA9MmZbA) and enter your GitHub username.
]

Tips for creating a username from [Happy Git with R](http://happygitwithr.com/github-acct.html#username-advice).

- Incorporate your actual name!
- Reuse your username from other contexts if you can, e.g., Twitter or Slack.
- Pick a username you will be comfortable revealing to your future boss.
- Shorter is better than longer.
- Be as unique as possible in as few characters as possible.
- Make it timeless. Donâ€™t highlight your current university, employer, or place of residence.
- Avoid words laden with special meaning in programming, like `NA`.

Raise your hand if you have any questions.

## Join RStudio.cloud 

- Go to [http://bit.ly/sta199-fa19-rstudio](http://bit.ly/sta199-fa19-rstudio), and log in with your GitHub credentials.

- You should see a project called *UN Votes*. Click "Copy"; this will create your copy of the project and launch it.


.instructions[
Raise your hand if you have any questions. 
]

---

## UN Votes Analysis

1. In the Files pane in the bottom right corner, spot the file called `unvotes.Rmd`. Open it, and then click on the "Knit" button.

2. Go back to the file and put your name in the author field at the top of the file (in the  `yaml` -- we will discuss what this is at a later date). Knit again.

3. Change the country names in parts 1 and 2 to countries that interest you. The spelling and capitalization must match what's in the data, so you can use the Appendix to see the correct spelling and capitalization. Knit again.

You have made your first data visualization!

## Discussion 

Discuss the following with a partner.

1. Start by introducing yourself! Name, year, major/ academic interest, favorite hobby.

2. Consider the plot in Part 1. Describe how the voting behaviors of the four countries have changed over time.

3. Consider the plot in Part 2. 
    - On which issues have the two countries voted most similarly in recent years?  
    - On which issues have they voted most differently in recent years? 
    - Has this changed over time?

</small>

---

## Excused Absences

- Students who miss a class due to a scheduled varsity trip, religious holiday, or short-term illness should fill out the respective form.
     - These excused absences do not excuse you from assigned work. 
--
- If you have a personal or family emergency or chronic health condition that affects your ability to participate in class, please contact your academic deanâ€™s office.
--

- Exam dates cannot be changed and no make-up exams will be given. 

---

## Late Work &amp; Regrade Requests

- Homework assignments: 
    - Late but within 24 hours of deadline: 20% penalty
    - Not accepted if submitted any later
    
- Late work will not be accepted for the take-home exams or final project. 

- Regrade requests must be submitted within one week of when the assignment is returned using the link posted in the course syllabus

---

## Academic Honesty

All work for this class should be done in accordance with the Duke Community Standard. 

> To uphold the Duke Community Standard:
> - I will not lie, cheat, or steal in my academic endeavors;
> - I will conduct myself honorably in all my endeavors; and
> - I will act if the Standard is compromised.

Any violations will automatically result in a grade of 0 on the assignment and will be reported to [Office of Student Conduct](https://studentaffairs.duke.edu/conduct) for further action.

---

## Reusing Code

- Unless explicitly stated otherwise, you may make use of online resources (e.g. StackOverflow) for coding examples on assignments. If you directly use code from an outside source (or use it as inspiration), you must or explicitly cite where you obtained the code. Any recycled code that is discovered and is not explicitly cited will be treated as plagiarism.

- On individual assignments, you may discuss the assignment with one another; however, you may not directly share code or write up with other students. 

- On team assignments, you may not directly share code or write up with another team. Unauthorized sharing of the code or write up will be considered a violation for all students involved. 

---

## Where to find help

- **If you have a question during lecture or lab, feel free to ask it!** There are likely other students with the same question, so by asking you will create a learning opportunity for everyone.

--

- **Office Hours**: A lot of questions are most effectively answered in-person, so office hours are a valuable resource. Please use them!

--

- **Piazza**: Outside of class and office hours, any general questions about course content or assignments should be posted on Piazza since there are likely other students with the same questions.

---

## Academic Resource Center

Sometimes you may need help with the class that is beyond what can be provided by the teaching team. In that instance, I encourage you to visit the Academic Resource Center.  
<br><br>

.small[
The [Academic Resource Center (ARC)](https://arc.duke.edu) offers free services to all students during their undergraduate careers at Duke.  Services include Learning Consultations, Peer Tutoring and Study Groups, ADHD/LD Coaching, Outreach Workshops, and more. Because learning is a process unique to every individual, they work with each student to discover and develop their own academic strategy for success at Duke. Contact the ARC to schedule an appointment. Undergraduates in any year, studying any discipline can benefit! Contact <a href="mailto:arc@duke.edu" title="email">ARC@duke.edu</a>, 919-684-5917, 211 Academic Advising Center Building, East Campus â€“ behind Marketplace.

---

## Technology 

- You should bring a laptop to every lecture and lab session.  Outlets are limited, so make sure it is fully-charged.

- Ensure the volume on all devices is set to mute.

- Refrain from engaging in activities not related to the class discussion. Browsing the web and social media, excessive messaging, playing games, etc. is not only a distraction for you but is also a distraction for everyone around you.

---

## Accessibility 

Please contact the [Student Disability Access Office (SDAO)](https://access.duke.edu) if there is an element of the course that is not accessible to you. There you can engage in a confidential conversation about the process for requesting reasonable accommodations. 
<br><br>

Please note that accommodations are not provided retroactively, so please contact them as soon as possible.  More information can be found online at [access.duke.edu](https://access.duke.edu). 

---

### Inclusion 

In this course, we will strive to create a learning environment that is welcoming to all students and that is in alignment with [Dukeâ€™s Commitment to Diversity and Inclusion](https://provost.duke.edu/initiatives/commitment-to-diversity-and-inclusion). If there is any aspect of the class that is not welcoming or accessible to you, please let me know immediately. 
<br><br> 

Additionally, if you are experiencing something outside of class that is affecting your performance in the course, please feel free to talk with me and/or your academic dean.
