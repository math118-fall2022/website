### Application Exercise: Popular TV Shows

RStudio Cloud $\rightarrow$ Web scraping 

1. Scrape the list of most popular TV shows on IMDB: http://www.imdb.com/chart/tvmeter

2. Examine each of the first three (or however many you can get through) tv show subpage to also obtain genre and runtime.

3. Time permitting, also try to get the following:

    - Genre
    - Runtime
    - How many episodes so far
    - First five plot keywords

Add this information to the data frame you created in step 1.

### Setup


```{r, warning = F, message = F}
library(tidyverse)
library(rvest)

pb <- read_html("https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2442560/")
st <- read_html("https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4574334/")
fr <- read_html("https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0108778/")
```

.center[
.pull-left[
```{r echo = F, out.width = '85%', out.height = '85%'}
knitr::include_graphics("img/06b/peaky_blinders.jpg")
```
]

.pull-right[
```{r echo = F, out.width = '85%', out.height = '85%'}
knitr::include_graphics("img/06b/stranger_things.png")
```
]

```{r echo = F, out.width = '37%', out.height = '37%'}
knitr::include_graphics("img/06b/friends.jpg")
```

### Why functions?

- Automate common tasks in a power powerful and general way than copy-and-pasting:
    - You can give a function an evocative name that makes your code easier to understand.
    - As requirements change, you only need to update code in one place, instead of many.
    - You eliminate the chance of making incidental mistakes when you copy and paste (i.e. updating a variable name in one place, but not in another).

--

- Down the line: Improve your reach as a data scientist by writing functions (and packages!) that others use

---

### When should you write a function?

Whenever youâ€™ve copied and pasted a block of code more than twice.

.question[
Do you see any problems in the code below?
]

.small[
```{r eval=FALSE}
pb_episode <- st %>%
  html_nodes(".bp_sub_heading") %>%
  html_text() %>%
  str_replace(" episodes", "") %>%
  as.numeric()

st_episode <- st %>%
  html_nodes(".bp_sub_heading") %>%
  html_text() %>%
  str_replace(" episodes", "") %>%
  as.numeric()

fr_episode <- fr %>%
  html_nodes(".bp_sub_heading") %>%
  html_text() %>%
  str_replace(" episodes", "") %>%
  as.numeric()
```
]

---

### Inputs

.question[
How many inputs does the following code have?
]

```{r eval=FALSE}
st_episode <- st %>%
  html_nodes(".bp_sub_heading") %>%
  html_text() %>%
  str_replace(" episodes", "") %>%
  as.numeric()
```

---

### Turn your code into a function

1. Pick a short but informative <font class="vocab">name</font>, preferably a verb.

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

```{r eval=FALSE}
scrape_episode <- 
  
  
  
  
  
  
```

---

### Turn your code into a function

1. Pick a short but informative **name**, preferably a verb.
2. List inputs, or <font class="vocab">arguments</font>, to the function inside `function`. If we had more inputs the call would look like `function(x, y, z)`.

<br>

```{r eval=FALSE}
scrape_episode <- function(x){
  
  
  
  
  
}  
```

---

### Turn your code into a function

1. Pick a short but informative **name**, preferably a verb.
2. List inputs, or **arguments**, to the function inside `function`. If we had more the call would look like `function(x, y, z)`.
3. Place the <font class="vocab">code</font> you have developed in body of the function, a `{` block that immediately follows `function(...)`.

```{r}
scrape_episode <- function(x){
  x %>%
    html_nodes(".bp_sub_heading") %>%
    html_text() %>%
    str_replace(" episodes", "") %>%
    as.numeric()
}
```

--

```{r}
scrape_episode(st)
```

---

### Check your function

[Peaky Blinders](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2442560/)

```{r}
scrape_episode(pb)
```

[Friends](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0108778/)

```{r}
scrape_episode(fr)
```

---

### Naming functions

> "There are only two hard things in Computer Science: cache invalidation and naming things." - Phil Karlton

--

- Names should be short but clearly evoke what the function does

--

- Names should be verbs, not nouns

--

- Multi-word names should be separated by underscores (`snake_case` as opposed to `camelCase`)

--

- A family of functions should be named similarly (`scrape_title`, `scrape_episode`, `scrape_genre`, etc.)

--

- Avoid overwriting existing (especially widely used) functions
    - e.g. don't name a function `summarise()`

---

### Scraping show info

.small[
```{r}
scrape_show_info <- function(x){

  title <- x %>%
    html_node("h1") %>%
    html_text(trim = TRUE) 

  runtime <- x %>%
    html_node("time") %>%
    html_text() %>% # could use trim = TRUE instead of str_ functions
    str_trim()
  
  genres <- x %>%
    html_nodes(".see-more.canwrap~ .canwrap a") %>%
    html_text() %>%
    str_c(collapse = ", ") %>%
    str_trim()
  
  tibble(title = title, runtime = runtime, genres = genres)
}
```
]

---

.small[
```{r}
scrape_show_info(pb)
scrape_show_info(st)
scrape_show_info(fr)
```
]

---

.question[
How would you update the following function to use the URL of the page as an argument?
]

.small[
```{r eval=FALSE}
scrape_show_info <- function(x){

  title <- x %>%
    html_node("h1") %>%
    html_text() %>%
    str_trim()

  runtime <- x %>%
    html_node("time") %>%
    html_text() %>%
    str_trim()
  
  genres <- x %>%
    html_nodes(".see-more.canwrap~ .canwrap a") %>%
    html_text() %>%
    str_trim() %>%
    paste(collapse = ", ")
  
  tibble(title = title, runtime = runtime, genres = genres)
}
```
]

---

.small[
```{r}
scrape_show_info <- function(x){
  
{{  y <- read_html(x) }}

  title <- y %>%
    html_node("h1") %>%
    html_text() %>%
    str_trim()

  runtime <- y %>%
    html_node("time") %>%
    html_text() %>%
    str_replace("\\n", "") %>%
    str_trim()

  genres <- y %>%
    html_nodes(".see-more.canwrap~ .canwrap a") %>%
    html_text() %>%
    str_trim() %>%
    paste(collapse = ", ")
  
  tibble(title = title, runtime = runtime, genres = genres)
}
```
]

---

### Let's check

.small[
```{r}
pb_url <- "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2442560/"
st_url <- "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4574334/"
fr_url <- "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0108778/"
```
]
--
.small[
```{r}
scrape_show_info(pb_url)
scrape_show_info(st_url)
scrape_show_info(fr_url)
```

# Automation

---

.question[
You now have a function that will scrape the relevant info on shows given its URL. Where can we get a list of URLs of top 100 most popular TV shows on IMDB? Write the code for doing this in your teams.
]

---

```{r}
urls <- read_html("http://www.imdb.com/chart/tvmeter") %>%
  html_nodes(".titleColumn a") %>%
  html_attr("href") %>%
  paste("http://www.imdb.com", ., sep = "")
```

```{r echo=FALSE}
urls
```

---

### Go to each page, scrape show info 

Now we need a way to programmatically direct R to each page on the `urls` list and run the `scrape_show_info` function on that page.

.small[
```{r}
scrape_show_info(urls[1])
scrape_show_info(urls[2])
scrape_show_info(urls[3])
```
]

---

### Oh no! 

### We're repeating our code again!

---

### Automation 

- We need a way to programmatically repeat the code

- There are two ways to do this: 
    - use a **`for`** loop
    - **`map`**ping with functional programming
    
---

### `for` loops

- **`for`** loops are the simplest and most common type of loop in R
- Iterate through the elements of a vector and evaluate the code block for each

**Goal**: Scrape info from individual pages of TV shows using iteration with for loops. We'll use only 5 shows for now to keep things simple.

---

### `for` loop

### 1) Set up a tibble to store the results

```{r}
n <- 5
top_n_shows <- tibble( title = rep(NA, n), 
                       runtime = rep(NA, n), 
                       genres = rep(NA, n)
  )
top_n_shows
```

---

### `for` loop

### 2) Iterate through urls to scrape data and save results

```{r}
for(i in 1:n){
  top_n_shows[i, ] = scrape_show_info(urls[i])
}
top_n_shows
```

---

### `map`ping

- **`map`** functions transform the input by applying a function to each element and returning an object the same length as the input

- There are various map functions (e.g. `map_lgl()`, `map_chr()`, `map_dbl()`, `map_df()`)
    - each of which return a different type of object (logical, character, double, and data frame, respectively)

--

- We will `map` the `scrape_show_info` function to each element of `urls`   
    - This will go to each url at a time and get the info
    
**Goal:** Scrape info from individual pages of TV shows using functional programming with mapping. We'll use only 5 shows for now to keep things simple.

---

### `map`: Go to each page, scrape show info 

```{r}
top_n_shows <- map_df(urls[1:n], scrape_show_info)
top_n_shows
```

---

### Slow down the function

- If you get `HTTP Error 429 (Too man requests)` you might want to slow down your hits.

- You can add a `Sys.sleep()` call to slow down your function:

```{r eval=FALSE}
scrape_show_info <- function(x){
#suspend execution between 0 to 1 seconds

  {{  Sys.sleep(runif(1)) }}
  
  ...

}
```
