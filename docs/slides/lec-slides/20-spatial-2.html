## Leaflet

---

## Leaflet

- Leaflet is a popular open-source JavaScript library for *interactive* maps

- We can access it via the `leaflet` package:


```r
library(leaflet)
```

---

## How to us Leaflet

We can create a Leaflet map with the following steps:

  1. Create a map *widget* by calling `leaflet()`
  
  2. Add layers (i.e. features) by using layer functions (e.g. `addPolygons`)
  
  3. Print the map widget to display it!
  
--

In the following, note that we use `%&gt;%` rather than `+` because we are *not* creating plots with `ggplot`!

---

## Example: Using OpenStreetMaps


```r
*leaflet()
```

<div id="htmlwidget-55fc67a6c4a558cbcbeb" style="width:1000px;height:400px;" class="leaflet html-widget"></div>
<script type="application/json" data-for="htmlwidget-55fc67a6c4a558cbcbeb">{"x":{"options":{"crs":{"crsClass":"L.CRS.EPSG3857","code":null,"proj4def":null,"projectedBounds":null,"options":{}}}},"evals":[],"jsHooks":[]}</script>

---

## Example: Using OpenStreetMaps


```r
leaflet() %&gt;% 
* addTiles() # Add default OpenStreetMap map tiles
```

<div id="htmlwidget-6ef99ff3e014059b1cca" style="width:1000px;height:400px;" class="leaflet html-widget"></div>
<script type="application/json" data-for="htmlwidget-6ef99ff3e014059b1cca">{"x":{"options":{"crs":{"crsClass":"L.CRS.EPSG3857","code":null,"proj4def":null,"projectedBounds":null,"options":{}}},"calls":[{"method":"addTiles","args":["https://{s}.tile.openstreetmap.org/{z}/{x}/{y}.png",null,null,{"minZoom":0,"maxZoom":18,"tileSize":256,"subdomains":"abc","errorTileUrl":"","tms":false,"noWrap":false,"zoomOffset":0,"zoomReverse":false,"opacity":1,"zIndex":1,"detectRetina":false,"attribution":"&copy; <a href=\"https://openstreetmap.org\">OpenStreetMap<\/a> contributors, <a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.0/\">CC-BY-SA<\/a>"}]}]},"evals":[],"jsHooks":[]}</script>

## Airport data

- Recall in last class we created `airports_count` data frame, which held the number of flights that flew to each airport from NYC





```r
airports_count %&gt;%
  slice(1:5)
```

```
## # A tibble: 5 × 9
