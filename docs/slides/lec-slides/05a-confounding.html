## `mutate`
(from September 5 lecture)

---

### `mutate` to add new variables

.small[

```r
ncbikecrash %&gt;% 
  mutate(driver_alcohol_drugs_simplified = case_when(
    is.na(driver_alcohol_drugs)             ~ driver_alcohol_drugs,
    driver_alcohol_drugs == "Missing"       ~ NA_character_,
    str_detect(driver_alcohol_drugs, "Yes") ~ "Yes",
    TRUE                                    ~ "No"
  ))
```
]
---

### "Save" when you `mutate`

Most often when you define a new variable with `mutate` you'll also want to save the resulting data frame, often by writing over the original data frame.


```r
*ncbikecrash &lt;- ncbikecrash %&gt;%
  mutate(driver_alcohol_drugs_simplified = case_when(
    is.na(driver_alcohol_drugs)             ~ driver_alcohol_drugs,
    driver_alcohol_drugs == "Missing"       ~ NA_character_,
    str_detect(driver_alcohol_drugs, "Yes") ~ "Yes",
    TRUE                                    ~ "No"
  ))
```

---

### Check before you move on


```r
ncbikecrash %&gt;% 
  count(driver_alcohol_drugs, driver_alcohol_drugs_simplified)
```

```

# Scientific studies

## Scientific studies

- &lt;font class="vocab"&gt;Observational&lt;/font&gt;
    - Collect data in a way that does not interfere with how the data arise ("observe")
    - Only establish an association
- &lt;font class="vocab"&gt;Experimental&lt;/font&gt;
    - Randomly assign subjects to treatments
    - Establish causal connections

.question[
Design a study comparing average energy levels of people who do and do not exercise -- both as an observational study and as an experiment.

### Study: "Cereal Keeps Girls Slim"

.small[
Girls who ate breakfast of any type had a lower average body mass index, a common obesity gauge, than those who said they didn't. The index was even lower for girls who said they ate cereal for breakfast, according to findings of the study conducted by the Maryland Medical Research Institute with funding from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and cereal-maker General Mills.

[...]

The results were gleaned from a larger NIH survey of 2,379 girls in California, Ohio, and Maryland who were tracked between the ages of 9 and 19.

[...]

As part of the survey, the girls were asked once a year what they had eaten during the previous three days.

[...]

### 3 possible explanations

--

- Eating breakfast causes girls to be slimmer 
&lt;br&gt;

--

- Being slim causes girls to eat breakfast
&lt;br&gt;

--

- A third variable is responsible for both -- a confounding variable 

--

.alert[
A &lt;font class="vocab"&gt;confounding&lt;/font&gt; variable is an an extraneous variable that affects both the explanatory and the response variable, and that make it seem like there is a relationship between them

### Non-random samples: a cautionary tale

In 2016, the Natural Environment Research Council in England
started an online competition in an effort to name a polar research
ship. People were invited to submit suggestions and/or cast a vote for
their favorite choice.

.question[
What type of sampling design is this?

Given that

- `\(P(\text{Very}~|~18-49) = \frac{90}{316} = 0.285\)`

- `\(P(\text{Very}~|~50+) = \frac{32}{184} = 0.173\)`

does there appear to be a relationship between age and familiarity with the DREAM act? Explain your reasoning.
]

--

&lt;br&gt;

.question[
Could there be another variable that explains this relationship?
]

---

## Independence

.question[
Inspired by the previous example and how we used the conditional probabilities to make conclusions, come up with a definition of independent events. If easier, you can keep the context limited to the example (independence/dependence of familiarity with the DREAM act and age), but try to push yourself to make a more general statement.

# Simpson's paradox

---

## Relationships between variables

- **Bivariate relationship**: Fitness `\(\rightarrow\)` Heart health

- **Multivariate relationship**: Calories + Age + Fitness `\(\rightarrow\)` Heart health

---

## Simpson's paradox

- Not considering an important variable when studying a relationship can result in &lt;font class="vocab"&gt;Simpson's paradox&lt;/font&gt;, a phenomenon in which the omission of one explanatory variable can affect the measure of association between another explanatory variable and a response variable. 


- In other words, the inclusion of a third variable in the analysis can change the apparent relationship between the other two variables.

## Data

- Is one hospital more effective than the other at treating a certain disease? 
- To answer this question, we will analyze the treatment outcomes for a 100 patients at each hospital.
