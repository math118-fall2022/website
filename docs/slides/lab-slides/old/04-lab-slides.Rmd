## Agenda

1. Lab 04: Wrangling Spatial Data
2. Getting started with lab
3. Password caching

## Lab 04: Wrangling spatial data

- Same data set as Lab 03, but using only US locations
- Keep the two data frames (Denny's and La Quinta) separate
- Join these data frames in a way that lists all possible pairings of Denny's and La Quinta locations in a given state

- Calculate the distances between the establishments and compare across a few states where Mitch Hedberg's joke seems more likely to hold true

## Getting started with lab

.small[
- Go to the course GitHub organization and find the **lab-04** repo that has your team name on it.

- On GitHub, click on the green Clone or download button, select Use HTTPS. Click on the clipboard icon to copy the repo URL.

- Go to RStudio Cloud and into the STA199 course workspace. Create a New Project from Git repo. You will need to click on the down arrow next to the New Project button to see this option.

- Copy and paste the URL of your assignment repo into the dialog box and hit OK.

- Run the following in the console to configure Git: 

```{r eval=FALSE}
library(usethis)
use_git_config(user.name="github username", user.email="your email")
```
]

## Caching your password

You need to cache your password on a per-project basis: 

- Go to the **Terminal** within a project (the most recent lab?)
- Type the following to cache your password for $60 * 60 * 24 * 7 = 604800$ seconds

```{bash eval=FALSE}
git config --global credential.helper 'cache --timeout 604800'
```

You will need to enter your GitHub username and password one more time after caching the password. After that you won't need to enter your credentials for 604800 seconds = 7 days.
