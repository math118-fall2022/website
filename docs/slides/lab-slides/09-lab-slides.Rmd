## Agenda

- Lab 09 overview

---

### Lab 09: Simulation-based inference

**Data:** Random sample of births from North Carolina

**Goals:** 

- Understand risk factors for infant health
- Use simulation based testing to estimate and test

---

## Setting a seed

- We'll be randomly sampling, so make sure to set a seed.

- All members of a given team should use the same seed to get the same results.

---

## Lab flow

- Part 1: Baby weights

- Part 2: Baby weight vs. smoking

Each part requires some data wrangling and visualization along with the inference component

---

## Getting started with lab

.small[
- Go to the course GitHub organization and find the **lab-09** repo that has your team name on it.

- On GitHub, click on the green Clone or download button, select Use HTTPS. Click on the clipboard icon to copy the repo URL.

- Go to RStudio Cloud and into the STA199 course workspace. Create a New Project from Git repo. You will need to click on the down arrow next to the New Project button to see this option.

- Copy and paste the URL of your assignment repo into the dialog box and hit OK.

- Run the following in the console to configure Git: 

```{r eval=FALSE}
library(usethis)
use_git_config(user.name="github username", user.email="your email")
```
